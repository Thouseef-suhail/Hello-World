# Hello-World
THE APPROACH:

STARTED WITH PREPROCESSING STEPS:
THEN THERE WERE EMPTY SPACES IN EXCEL, WE FILLED WITH NAN.
THERE WERE DUPLICATES IN THE FILE WE REMOVED THEM BECAUSE THERE WERE OF NO USE, THE LAST UPDATED RECORDS WILL BE KEPT AND PREVIOUS RECORDS WILL BE DISCARDED.
THEN WE BINNED THE COMPLETE ID WITH POOR, AVERAGE AND OUTSTANDING.
WE LABELLED THE POOR AS 1, AVERAGE AS 2 AND OUTSTANDING WITH 3.
THE MODEL BUILDING:
THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION GAVE GOOD RESULTS.
